Email list management and subscription gathering as a service you run yourself.

Like all those other services, but you control all the data, and can make changes to the platform.
It's open source, you see.

**Steadily moving towards 0.1.0, which will be useful in actual production. Don't use it yet.**

Interested in the project?
Open an issue or get in touch at [niels@deranged.dk](mailto:niels@deranged.dk).
Any and all help appreciated.
